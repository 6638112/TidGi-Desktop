## About TiddlyGit-Desktop

TiddlyGit is a cross-platform desktop app that make [nodejs-TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5#installing-tiddlywiki-on-nodejs) easy to access.

### Why Github?

Because Github is one of the best free civil [BaaS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/backend-as-a-service-baas-for-efficient-software-development_519851):

1. Its storage is basically free, allow us to store unlimited images and pdf files, which can have permanent URIs for public download
1. It has GraphQL API that allow us programmatically update our wiki
1. It has free [CI](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically deploy our TiddlyWiki blog
1. It provides unlimited repository, public and private, which enables us to store private content into our TiddlyWiki

### Why not [TiddlyDesktop](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyDesktop)?

Main reasons:

1. NodeJS version of TiddlyWiki have seamless auto-save experience, which is taking the advantage of SyncAdaptor instead of Syncer
1. We can have separated tiddler files, which can be modified by hand, or by other programs (e.g. VSCode with [VSCode-TW5-Syntax](https://github.com/joshuafontany/VSCode-TW5-Syntax))
1. Though TiddlyDesktop can load wiki folder generated by nodejs-TiddlyWiki, it can't backup that folder to the Github easily
1. With the electron as a shell, I can use `fs`, `git` and many other nodejs things within TiddlyWiki, which greatly extend the hackability.

## Credits

The desktop app shell is based on [https://github.com/atomery/singlebox](atomery/singlebox) and [atomery/webcatalog](https://github.com/atomery/webcatalog), they provide lots of utils around website-generated-app, much powerful than generating app from website simply using Chrome. Also the independent developer @quanglam2807 behind these great tools helps me a lot when I develop TiddlyGit.
